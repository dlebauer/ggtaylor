# A package implementing Taylor diagrams using ggplot2

The goal of ggtaylor is to implement the ability to generate Taylor Diagrams (Taylor, 2001) as a ggplot2 geom.

I spent a few hours building this out because 1) I couldn't find any other implementations and 2) I wanted to start exeperimenting with the modern package development suite of tools (especially the usethis package). I thought this was going to be easy, but it got very complex very quickly!

There are already implementations in the [plotrix](https://rdrr.io/cran/plotrix/man/taylor.diagram.html), and [openair](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair/reference/TaylorDiagram.html).

Not sure when I will get back to it again but **Contributions Welcome!!**

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggtaylor like so:

``` r
#pak::pkg_install("dlebauer/ggtaylor")
devtools::load_all()
```

## Example

This is a basic example of the intended use:

```r
library(ggtaylor)
# Create the plot
d <- data.frame(
  obs = rnorm(100),
  mod = rnorm(100),
  model = rep(c("A", "B"), 50)
)
ggplot(data = d) +
  geom_taylor(aes(x = obs, y = mod, color = model)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Correlation", breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2),
                     labels = function(x) round(cos(x * pi/2), 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Standard Deviation") +
  theme_minimal()
```
